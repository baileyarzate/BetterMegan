# BetterMegan: Bringing Your Smart Device to Life with Google's Gemini LLM

This project lets you leverage Google's Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) to potentially turn your smart devices into engaging conversational companions.

## What is Included:

This guide provides a basic framework to utilize Gemini's capabilities for natural conversations with your smart devices.
It outlines how to format user attributes and construct queries to guide the LLM's responses in a friendly and personalized manner.

## Getting Started:
1. Prerequisites: This project assumes you have access to Google's Gemini LLM API (details and instructions for access can be found on https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/).
2. User Attributes: This framework utilizes user attributes to personalize the device's responses. These attributes can include the user's age, interests, and even the device's name.
3. LLM Response: The LLM will process the query and generate a response tailored to the user, mimicking a friendly and engaging conversation.
4. Query Construction: Based on the user's question and the user attributes, you'll construct a query for the LLM. This query should provide context and guide the LLM's response style.
   
## Example:

Imagine a 12-year-old boy named Alex who loves sports and video games. His new smart speaker is named Spark.

User Attributes:
Name: Alex
Age: 12
Gender: Male
Interests: Sports, Video Games
Device Name: Spark
Query:

[LLM speaks like a 10-12 year old boy who is a friend, and speaks mostly about the postive things] I am a Alex who loves sports and video games.  You're my new smart speaker named Spark! What are things I can ask you? 

LLM Response (Example): Hey Alex! That's awesome you got a new smart speaker! What's up?  Want to hear some highlights from the latest game or maybe check the weather for your next baseball practice?  I can do tons of stuff, just ask!

## Remember:

This is a basic framework. You can customize the user attributes, query construction, and even integrate text-to-speech functionality to bring Spark's responses to life!

## Further Exploration:

Experiment with different user attributes and see how they influence the LLM's responses.
Explore creative ways to integrate the LLM's responses with your device's features (e.g., light displays, sound effects).
Remember to prioritize safety and age-appropriateness when using the LLM for interactions.

## Future work:
- Fine tune the LLM to better speak to subgroups of people.
- Keep an evolving attribute list, user should never have to edit the attribute list in practice.
- LLM should avoid "bad" outputs.
